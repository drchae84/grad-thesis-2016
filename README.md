# RISD Graduate Thesis Exhibition 2016

A catalog site created for the annual RISD Graduate Thesis Exhibition. The site was designed in collaboration with Diane Lee, Rebecca Leffell Koren, and Gabriel Melcher. The goal of the site was to create a simple directory-like listing of all the artists and designers whose work was exhibited in the show. All development was done by myself with special help from Bo-Won Keum. 
Simple jquery interactions are used to navigate what would be an sprawling list.
